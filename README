= Synchronized Data Structures

* http://death.rubyforge.org
* http://death.rubyforge.org/sync


== ABSTRACT

Sync provides a set of classes, equivalent to built-in Ruby classes
but autmatically synchronized for use in multi-threaded applications.


== SYNOPSIS

Use the classes provided pretty much just as you would the normal classes.

  require 'sync/hash'

  hash = SyncHash.new
  hash = SyncHash.new(Hash.new)   # Delegate


== FUTURE VERSION

Wondering if it would be prudent to move the classes into the Sync namespace, i.e.

  SyncHash  ->  Sync::Hash
  SyncArray ->  Sync::Array


== HOW TO INSTALL

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  gem install sync

Local installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  tar -xvzf sync-1.0.0.tar.gz
  cd sync-1.0.0
  sudo setup.rb all

Windows users use 'ruby setup.rb all'.
